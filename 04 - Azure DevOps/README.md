# Azure Devops

### Create an Azure account 
```xml
Search for "Azure free tier" and click the link. For me the below link appeared. 
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free

Click on Free Account and create the account (note CC is needed for this process)

Once the registration is complete, click on "Go to Azure Portal"
The url is: 
https://portal.azure.com/

First thing is create a budget under subscription so that you can be alerted on the cost. 

 ```

 ### Azure DevOps
```xml
Search for Azure DevOps Services -> Go the page and click on "Start Free"
Next click on the user settings (in the right corner) -> Click on preview features -> Mutlistage pipelines -> Enable (this was not shown in my profile - newer systems dont show this as it is already an inbuilt feature)
Create new Project -> azure-devops-k8s-terraform -> private project -> create project
Pipelines (From left menu) -> Pipelines -> Create Pipelines 

 ```
